      <p>Last year I lost my mind and made a rather long (for me) <a href="https://mage.tumblr.com/post/631276555163893761/comics-masterpost">camileda meet cute comic</a> in a very short amount of time all for a dumb joke that everyone else had already made. I wanted to explore more of the scenario that developed while laying the groundwork for said dumb joke and people kept asking me for the nsfw scene I faded to black so, uh, here we are. 300k of smutty fanfic.</p>
<p>The smut is mostly frontloaded until plot that isn't porn happens so, yeah, enjoy my horribly unbalanced fanfic!</p>
<p>Also there's random art in some of the chapters because I really do wish I could have made this a comic even though I refuse to draw nsfw. If there is no alt text for the images, it's because they add zero new content to the story and are just an illustration of something in that scene.</p>

    <p>The last bus of the night drove off, leaving Camila blinking under the anaemic streetlight half a block from home. The branches overhead swayed and the light flickered as Camila walked away, her mind numb after her third double shift of the week. All she could think of was that dumb bit of neighbourhood gossip her ex-husband insisted on telling her, something about tree branches blocking streetlights and one of Camila's neighbours' refusal to follow city ordinances to trim them. It was the hot topic of last week, not that any of her neighbours would have told her. Raul got the goodwill of their neighbours as well as the house in the divorce, leaving Camila to the subject of the gossip circuit.</p>
<p>They would be talking about her again tomorrow if anyone was awake and watching her drag her feet back home. That Dr Noceda; was her hair dishevelled because she had a long day at the clinic or was she making the walk of shame early, rolling out of a stranger's bed without enjoying the afterglow?</p>
<p>Camila wished it was the latter—she couldn't remember the last time she had taken a woman to bed. Months now, at least. Before summer, when the other vets started going on vacation and leaving her to cover their shifts as well as Daniel's, who had abruptly retired as soon as the snow had started to melt. His position hadn't been filled; the clinic unwilling to allocate funds to hire a replacement while he was burning the last of his leave before officially retiring.</p>
<p>The only good thing about working endless unpaid overtime was that Camila was much too tired to even think about sex, let alone miss it. She didn't even have the energy to keep her eyes fully open as she shuffled down the sidewalk, the street getting progressively darker the further she got from the bus stop. Which was fine—Camila had walked that half block twice a day for over three years—until the toe of her shoe caught on a slab of concrete and she stumbled, a hot burst of pain shooting up her lower back.</p>
<p>Groaning, she pressed a hand to her back as she staggered forward. Of all the things she had she had mentally prepared for upon turning thirty, constant mild back pain wasn't something she had even considered. Wasn't chronic pain from an ageing body supposed to be something you got in middle age? She was too young to be middle aged.</p>
<p>By the time she pulled herself up the three steps at her front door, she had forgotten the back pain in her frustration at fumbling for keys in the dark. The screen door pressed against her back, sandwiching her between the doors, as she resorted to trying all three of her matching keys one by one until the handle turned. Just like last year, she knew she should put a timer on her porch light before the snow fell so that she wouldn't spend a fourth winter stuck outside with numb fingers while her keys slipped from her grasp. She knew she wouldn't find the time.</p>
<p>The inside of her house was pitch black and blessedly cool after the muggy September heat, the A/C having kicked in hours before when her shift was supposed to end. Her stomach felt hollow, but the best thing to do would be to go straight upstairs, shower off the day's grime and curl up in bed to read until she fell asleep.</p>
<p>She veered into her living room instead and collapsed onto her couch, not bothering to turn on the lights. Her feet went onto the coffee table one aching foot at a time and she groaned as they throbbed. It would feel better with her shoes off, but the apathy was beginning to set in as she sunk into the couch. Who needed to eat or shower or read or go to bed? She could spend the night here on the couch, watching Netflix until she passed out—the sun could wake her in the morning if her phone battery didn't hold out.</p>
<p>Her stomach gnawed. She hadn't eaten anything since shoving a scavenged slice of pizza into her mouth between patients five hours ago. Everyone said you weren't supposed to eat before bed, but food was a more enticing prospect than her bed and Camila's back couldn't survive a night on the couch.</p>
<p>The trip to the kitchen was hardly worth it, only wilting produce and half empty takeout containers in her fridge. At least she had tossed her shoes into the front entrance on her way and her toes spread out on the cool lino. She couldn't remember if she had ordered Indian takeout on Monday or Tuesday, but she didn't smell anything off in the container of chana masala and that was just chickpeas. It wasn't as if chickpeas went bad, right? It would probably be fine.</p>
<p>It still tasted good, but Camila regretted having inhaled every piece of naan on Tuesday (or possibly Monday). Carbs, she really wanted straight carbs right now. Not enough to eat a slice of the stale bread on her counter, but enough to make the leftovers slightly disappointing.</p>
<p>It only took a few bites to make her stop feeling like she was starving, that discontent ache of neither hunger or satiation overtaking her body. Annoyed, she tossed the takeout container into the garbage and dropped her fork in the sink, the dishwasher full of clean dishes from yesterday. Another thing to deal with tomorrow before picking up Luz from Raul's, alongside clearing out her fridge and buying groceries to restock it. Not that Luz cared about fresh produce, but like hell she would be the parent to feed her kid nothing but takeout.</p>
<p>The small amount of food made her more lethargic and she stared unseeing at her reflection in the window. The numbers were hard to grasp, but she was pretty sure she had passed her seventieth hour of work this week sometime near the tail end of her shift and time was beginning to have no meaning. Only eight more hours tomorrow and it was the weekend, but it may as well have been eighty.</p>
<p>There was also only eight more hours until her alarm went off. She was burning precious time that could be spent sleeping, but she didn't move and blinked at her reflection. She looked like shit, her hair scraggly where it escaped the bun, and her concealer worn away, betraying the heavy bags under her eyes.</p>
<p>Upstairs. Bed. No shower, she would wash the sheets with the laundry this weekend. No reading either, lest she stay up until she was overtired and couldn't sleep at all.</p>
<hr/><p>Her last shift of the week dragged and, once it finished, Camila went straight to her ex's house. Her old house. The house they had bought together when they couldn't afford it because Camila became pregnant six months into her residency.</p>
<p>Full of endless energy, Luz launched herself at Camila as soon as she walked through the door. Camila squeezed Luz to her and turned her tired eyes away from Raul's gaze.</p>
<p>"You all packed?"</p>
<p>"Yup! What are we going to do tonight?" Luz bounced on her toes even while clinging onto her mother.</p>
<p>Sleep.</p>
<p>"How about you pick?" She knew it was a mistake as soon as the words left her mouth; Luz always picked something physically intensive when she was vibrating.</p>
<p>"Hmm." Luz pulled back from her and put on her pondering face, stroking an invisible beard. "We could go for a bike ride! Or for a hike!"</p>
<p>Even the walk back to her house seemed like too much exercise right now, but Camila had been slacking on her gym routine and Luz was a tiny thing. Camila could keep up with a six year old. She hoped.</p>
<p>"Both sound like fun. How about you grab your bag and we'll decide on the walk home."</p>
<p>"Okay!" Luz ran deeper into the house—Raul was terrible for encouraging organisation—and Camila no longer had the child as a buffer between her and her ex.</p>
<p>"Camila," Raul started and he continued to talk as Camila lifted a staying hand. "You're two hours late."</p>
<p>"Don't start. I've been hearing it all week from Ann already."</p>
<p>"If you won't listen to your coworkers, will you at least listen to me? You're obviously exhausted. I can keep Luz for an extra night if you need to catch up on sleep—we both know that Luz will be up at the crack of dawn tomorrow."</p>
<p>Camila's lips thinned. He meant well, but he never went a full week without seeing their daughter. Even half dead on her feet, Camila wouldn't give up a single precious minute with Luz.</p>
<p>"I'm fine."</p>
<p>Raul opened his mouth to reply, probably with a 'you don't look fine', but Luz saved Camila the trouble of shooting Raul down again by barrelling into Raul's legs.</p>
<p>"Bye Papa!"</p>
<p>Raul bent down and lifted a giggling Luz, along with the backpack that Camila knew was stuffed to the brim with heavy books, into his arms. "Bye <em>mija</em>! You be good for your mama, okay? I'll see you on Monday after school!"</p>
<p>Luz squirmed and Raul let her down. Once her feet touched the floor, Luz ran to Camila's side, grabbing her mom's hand with both of her tiny ones. "Let's go! I'm hungry! What are we having for supper?"</p>
<p>What Camila wouldn't give to order delivery on a day like today. "How does mac and cheese sound?"</p>
<p>"Yay!" Luz tugged Camila out the door and Camila smiled down at her, sparing only a single guilty glance of farewell at Raul.</p>
<hr/><p>On Monday, Camila woke, still exhausted, not to the sound of her alarm clock, but to the sound of a six year old pulling cutlery out of a drawer. She turned her head, hid her face in her pillow and longed for nothing more than a return to sleep.</p>
<p>One hand patted at her sheets, searching for the phone she didn't remember putting down before falling asleep. Her hand bumped into it, sending it skidding along the mattress, dangerously close to the edge. She slapped down on her phone and dragged it towards her, squinting in the dark as she tapped the screen. When there was no response, she flipped the phone over and tried again.</p>
<p>The phone stayed dark and she swore, pulling at the charging cable until the usb end was in her hand, not in the outlet where it belonged. No wonder she had slept through her alarm, presuming that it was even time to get up and Luz wasn't downstairs pouring a bowl of cereal at four am again.</p>
<p>The numbers fuzzy from sleep and poor vision, Camila squinted at the alarm clock on her nightstand. "Shit."</p>
<p>There was no time for a shower, so Camila freshened up as best as she could before stumbling downstairs and into the kitchen. She didn't have time to run the coffee maker either, but toast was doable.</p>
<p>"Good morning mama!" Luz was much too cheerful and Camila smiled weakly.</p>
<p>"Good morning, mija. Did you sleep well?"</p>
<p>Luz nodded vigorously. "I had the best dream! You were there and we were at this park with the biggest slide I had ever seen, so big that it touched the clouds!"</p>
<p>"That does sound like the best dream." Camila ruffled Luz's hair. "Did we go down the slide?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh! And then the slide disappeared and we started to fly! And then other stuff happened but I already forgot it."</p>
<p>"Dreams are tricky like that." Camila held back a yawn. "Are you packed for school?"</p>
<p>"Yup!"</p>
<p>"Then you better run upstairs and brush your teeth. Your bus will be here in ten minutes."</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>Luz thundered up the stairs, impressively loud for a forty pound child, and Camila took a weary bite of toast. Her toast wasn't even half finished by the time Luz came running back down the stairs and Camila blinked slowly. She set it down on her plate before shuffling into her front entrance, where Luz was sitting on the floor and tugging on her rubber boots. There was no rain on the forecast today, and no standing puddles of water, but Camila just rubbed at her eyes. Maybe it made her a bad mother, but she was too tired to try and convince Luz to wear proper shoes.</p>
<p>"Can I get a hug before you leave?" Camila asked as Luz climbed to here feet.</p>
<p>She opened her arms and knelt as Luz threw herself into Camila. Camila squeezed her tight and pushed down her tears. It was just the fatigue bringing tears to her eyes, she could control this. She could control herself.</p>
<p>After a long minute, Camila let Luz go, her hand at her back as she stood up. "You better get going now. Have a good day at school!"</p>
<p>Luz waved over her shoulder. "Bye mama, I love you!"</p>
<p>"I love you too, mija." Camila didn't close the door. Instead, she leaned against the frame and watched as her daughter walked down the road until turned the corner, heading to the bus stop halfway between Camila and her ex's house. Ten minutes until Camila's bus arrived—so much for her toast, though it had likely cooled the point of inedibility by now.</p>
<hr/><p><div><img longdesc="https://exmage.com/ext/iil/ch01.png" src="images/ffdl-0.png"/></div>
</p>
<p>There was a woman Camila didn't know at her bus stop.</p>
<p>Camila wouldn't say that she knew everyone in the neighbourhood who took her bus, but she'd say she knew every pretty girl who did. And this woman was more than just pretty—she was striking, over six feet tall with a wild shock of greying ginger hair that shone bright in the sunlight.</p>
<p>She hadn't noticed Camila yet, too busy talking to the small owl nestled in the palm of her hand, and Camila pretended to be absorbed by her phone. It wasn't the redhead's beauty that had turned Camila's stomach into a roiling knot of nerves—she was notorious for pursuing women out of her league and luring them into her bed. It wasn't even the docile owl that seemed to understand every word the woman said—Camila had worked with plenty of sharp eyed birds. It was the tips of long, pointed ears that peaked out of the mess of her hair that set Camila on edge.</p>
<p>The woman wasn't human.</p>
<p>A dark, instinctual frisson of fear travelled along Camila's spine. She kept walking forward, tamping down on her desire to run. She was being irrational; there was no such thing elves or fae or any of the other mythological creatures Luz was fascinated by. Camila was overexposed to her daughter's fantasies and mistaking a simple body modification for naturally pointed ears. With the woman's ripped dress and fuck me boots, she looked like she was coming home from a punk show that had lasted until sunrise and an alt rocker would be the exact sort of person to mod their ears for the shock value.</p>
<p>Despite her best attempts at subtlety, the woman noticed Camila's furtive looks and she fluffed out her hair, the tips of her ears vanishing from sight. She also sidled up beside Camila, keeping pace as Camila walked the last few steps to the bus stop.</p>
<p>"Hey huu—yooouu, what brings you here?"</p>
<p>"The bus." Now that it was too late, Camila kept her eyes glued to her phone.</p>
<p>"Come here often?"</p>
<p>"Only when I want to catch the bus," Camila said. She still refused to look up, but she could feel the presence of the woman beside her, warm and friendly, and her gravely voice was enticing.</p>
<p>"C'mon, are you going to make me carry the entire conversation?"</p>
<p>The flirtation was too much for Camila to resist. She was but a simple lesbian, far from immune to the charms of a interested woman. She glanced up from her phone, looking askance at the other woman with a single eyebrow raised. "Who said I want to have a conver—"</p>
<p>Camila cut herself off, forgetting the rest of her sentence as she got her first proper look at the redhead.</p>
<p>She had golden eyes. Not golden as in a poetic way to describe someone with pale brown eyes, but actual molten gold, deep and rich and matching the single fang poking out of her mouth.</p>
<p>She absolutely wasn't human.</p>
<p>Camila's heart thundered in her chest but she couldn't look away. Instead, she looked closer, taking in the gold stone on her chest and the way her lipstick didn't smudge against that fang as her lips curled into a smirk. A soft hoot drew Camila's gaze upwards to the small owl nestled in the woman's hair, streaked with grey at the temples.</p>
<p>"There's an owl in your hair." Camila's voice was remote, speaking without conscious thought as her mind went through all the myriad of ways someone who looked human but was not human could kill her.</p>
<p>"Well, they don't call me the owl lady for nothing." The woman pointed a proud thumb at her chest and the little owl hooted again. Camila could have sworn that it rolled its eyes before ruffling out one wing, almost as if it was waving at her.</p>
<p>The screech of the bus pulling up made relief fluttered in her stomach; surely the woman wouldn't try anything funny in front of an audience. Camila didn't even wait until the bus doors were fully open before stepping on.</p>
<p>But she paused, one foot still on the sidewalk, and remembered one of the many warnings from Luz's favourite book of mythology. Powerful mythological beings didn't like rude mortals.</p>
<p>She looked back. The other woman was still smiling at her, still disarmingly pretty.</p>
<p>"This is my bus," Camila said. "So, uh, bye."</p>
<p>She didn't meet the bus driver's eyes as she swiped her transit card. The redhead was boarding the bus behind her and the really dumb part of Camila, the part that saw a beautiful woman and had to have her, no matter the consequences, took over and Camila smiled at the stranger as she swung around into her seat.</p>
<p>Her smile widened at the bus driver's words.</p>
<p>"No uncaged pets," he said, holding out a hand to prevent the redhead from taking another step onto the bus.</p>
<p>"But Owlbert is perfectly well behaved!" the owl lady said and her owl honest to god nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>The bus driver stood up.</p>
<p>"No." He took a step forward. The redhead stepped back and stumbled, falling back onto the sidewalk. Camila winced and peered out the window, but the woman seemed fine, just startled. She stared up at Camila with wide eyes and Camila smirked, raising one hand in a teasing farewell as the bus pulled away.</p>
<p>She settled back into her seat, still smirking as she met the bus driver's questioning eyes in the mirror. She raised an eyebrow and shrugged minutely. Now that the adrenaline was fading as the bus pulled her further and further away from danger, Camila had to admit to herself that she was flattered. It wasn't every day that a woman that was otherworldly beautiful flirted with her.</p>
<hr/><p>The first thing Camila did when she arrived at work was to start the coffeemaker in the break room and linger as she waited for it to percolate. She hadn't taken a single sip before her boss cornered her and, from the faux pleading look on his face, Camila knew exactly what he was going to ask.</p>
<p>Slumping her shoulders and blinking tiredly through her glasses, she didn't make it easy on him. She knew the bags under her eyes were prominent, even with the concealer she had smeared on while riding the bus.</p>
<p>Her boss faltered, but he plastered a hearty smile on his face. "Camila! Are you available to work this weekend? It's your ex's turn with your kid, right?"</p>
<p>Camila took a long sip of her coffee. "I was hoping to have this weekend off."</p>
<p>"I know, and I wouldn't ask, but Collins covered last weekend and everyone else is busy."</p>
<p>Busy getting in one last round of golf before the weather turned.</p>
<p>She didn't miss the unspoken attempt at a guilt trip, but that didn't mean it wasn't working. Collins was pulling nearly as many long shifts at the clinic as Camila.</p>
<p>"And I covered the weekend before that. And every other weekend before <em>that</em> for the past five months."</p>
<p>"Oh, alright. Do you know if he's in yet? I know he's been finding it difficult to get to work on time, what with the new baby and all."</p>
<p>Camila sighed and pushed her glasses up to pinch her nose. "Fine, I'll work it."</p>
<p>"Are you sure? You're looking a bit—" her boss paused and his expression turned frantic as he grasped for a polite way to say that Camila looked like shit.</p>
<p>"—Tired?" Camila volunteered. "I am."</p>
<p>"Not as bad as when you first started your residency here?" Her boss had a hopeful look on his face. "Nothing is as bad as that year, all those mat leaves made so much work for the rest of us!"</p>
<p>"No, nothing is as bad as my residency." Camila spent her residency battling morning sickness, giving birth and caring for a colicky baby. She hadn't got a mat leave.</p>
<p>"I'm glad to hear it!" He reached out as if he was going to clap Camila on the shoulder and then, as if he was remembering all those interminable videos on appropriate workplace conduct they all had to sit through once a year, drew back. "Thanks for always helping out, Camila."</p>
<p>"Uh huh." She took a sip of coffee as her boss hastily backed out of the break room.</p>
<p>A hand clapped Camila on the shoulder from behind in a parody of her boss' aborted gesture and she glanced down to see a small, fine boned hand.</p>
<p>"You have to learn to say no." Ann gave Camila's shoulder a squeeze before she let go. "He's not going to hire a replacement for Daniel if you and Collins keep picking up the slack."</p>
<p>"I know, but—"</p>
<p>"Say no, Camila. Sleep is nice."</p>
<p>Camila took another sip of coffee. It was hard to argue that.</p>
<hr/><p>Body too skewed to overtiredness, Camila didn't get much sleep again, which she forgot when she saw that the woman was back at her bus stop again. She was oblivious to the world, leaning against the sign with her nose in a thick book, and Mr Willison, the retiree who was up at seven am everyday to garden, stared openly.</p>
<p>Camila smiled. Of course a woman that beautiful wouldn't notice any lingering looks.</p>
<p>She didn't notice Camila either, much to her amusement. Maybe it was vain, but Camila hoped that the only reason the woman was at the bus stop was to meet her. It seemed unlikely that such a supernatural being had moved into her neighbourhood and wanted to commute to her nine-to-five job on a city bus.</p>
<p>Or maybe she liked the atmosphere of the bus stop—it also seemed unlikely that a supernatural being would pay any attention to Camila. Being whisked off on a magical adventure was Luz's dream, not hers.</p>
<p>Now that the woman was back, Camila was glad that she had held her tongue and not told Luz about her encounter yesterday morning. She still clung to the belief that magic was real, but the knowledge that Camila had met some sort of fantasy creature practically in their backyard would send Luz back to searching the forest for a portal to an alternate dimension. Camila couldn't live through the stress of searching the woods for her daughter past sunset yet again.</p>
<p>She studied the distracted woman closely. Her hair was still a short riotous puff, fluffed out to almost obscure her ears, and this close Camila was able to see the dark circles under the woman's eyes, mostly hidden under a layer of concealer and heavy eyeliner. Yesterday she had assumed that she was going prematurely grey, but fine lines around her eyes and mouth made her reconsider.</p>
<p>Then again, she wasn't human. Who knows how her species aged? She could be a thousand years old for all Camila knew. Like an elf. Elves were supposed to be long lived. She was certainly tall and slender enough to be an elf. Well over six feet tall, though her boots did have quite the heel. And she had the ears, but the fang and the wild mass of hair didn't fit any of the illustrations in any of Luz's books.</p>
<p>At the very least, she didn't seem dangerous, just kind of nerdy, lost to the world while reading a leather bound book with arcane symbols on the cover. The sort of book Luz would beg Camila to buy.</p>
<p>"How long have you been waiting here?" Camila smirked when the woman jumped with a yelp, clutching the book to her chest.</p>
<p>Though her cheeks were stained red, she didn't bother to deny it, even if her answer was a vague mumble that Camila didn't quite process, too distracted by how incongruously <em>cute</em> the woman was when blushing.</p>
<p>The way she vanished the heavy book into her hair was distracting too. That was magic. Actual, incontrovertible magic. Camila's heart began to beat faster as her last lingering doubt faded. The woman smiling down at her with a goofy grin really, really wasn't human.</p>
<p>"I left Owlbert at home so I can ride the bus this time!" the owl lady said.</p>
<p>"Uh huh." Camila struggled to regain her composure, her face frozen in a blank stare. The owl lady didn't seem too put off and, well, she was so damn friendly that Camila found herself relaxing again as the bus pulled up. "Well, here's your chance to try."</p>
<p>Camila boarded the bus first, smiling at the bus driver who was looking skeptically at the woman waiting on the curb.</p>
<p>"She bothering you?" the bus driver asked, his voice pitched low. Camila smiled and shook her head minutely as she swiped her card. She stepped aside, watching as the owl lady stared down at the card reader.</p>
<p>"You could always pay in cash," Camila prompted.</p>
<p>The owl lady flushed again and turned away. Camila snickered and the bus driver stood up.</p>
<p>"No free rides," he growled and the owl lady backed away, once again misjudging her steps and falling backwards out of the bus.</p>
<p>Weren't elves supposed to be supernaturally graceful?</p>
<p>Camila dropped into the front seat, digging in her purse for her notebook and a sharpie. She hastily scribbled out a message—'BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME'—and held the notepad up against the window as the bus drove away.</p>
<p>Camila leaned back in her seat and gave the driver a wide smile in thanks for his willingness to linger long enough for Camila to make and display her sign.</p>
<hr/><p>Camila wasn't surprised to see the woman waiting at the bus stop the next morning, this time sprawled out in the shade of Mr Willison's carefully pruned azalea bushes while reading her book. She wasn't as dead to the world this time, and she looked up as Camila approached, once again tucking the book away into her hair.</p>
<p>Camila ignored the magic. "Trying again?"</p>
<p>"Third time's the charm." The woman winked before hopping up off the ground with a spryness Camila envied.</p>
<p>But the bus was already rolling up to the curb. It was early today—or, rather, on time— leaving no time for conversation. Not unless the owl lady had scrounged up cash.</p>
<p>She hadn't, though she had made an attempt. Camila and the bus driver exchanged bemused glances as the redhead held out a handful of colourful bills.</p>
<p>"Keep the change," the woman said proudly.</p>
<p>"Uh," Camila said.</p>
<p>"Is that monopoly money?" the bus driver asked.</p>
<p>"What?" the owl lady asked. She held the bills out closer to the driver. "Are you going to let me ride this thing or not?"</p>
<p>The bus driver stood up. "Absolutely not."</p>
<p>"What the hell? Is this not money? This one has a hundred on it; you can't tell me that doesn't cover the cost of a bus fare!"</p>
<p>"It would if it wasn't fake money for a kids board game. Get out."</p>
<p>The woman managed to not trip when backing out of the bus this time and Camila hurried to write another note.</p>
<p>"Where did you find this one? She seems a bit touched." The bus driver watched Camila through the mirror. He waited at the curb until Camila held up her note, which simply read 'FOURTH TIME?', to the window, though, and Camila gave him another smile after the owl lady was out of sight.</p>
<p>"She's pretty, though," Camila said and the bus driver gave a conceding nod, though the skeptical expression never left his face.</p>
